## Usage Guide

### Data Preparation
1. Navigate to "Data Preparation" page
2. Upload `kaggle.json` or configure API credentials
3. Click "Download Dataset" button
4. Wait for download and extraction to complete
5. Verify dataset statistics

### Model Training
1. Navigate to "Model Training" page
2. Select model size (nano for speed, medium for accuracy)
3. Configure training parameters:
   - Epochs: 50-100 (higher = better accuracy, longer training)
   - Image Size: 640 (standard for YOLO)
   - Batch Size: 16 (adjust based on GPU memory)
4. Click "Start Training"
5. Monitor training progress
6. Wait for completion (may take 30+ minutes)

### Live Detection
1. Navigate to "Live Detection" page
2. Upload a construction site or workplace image
3. Adjust confidence threshold (0.25 default)
4. View detection results with annotations
5. Review safety violations and compliance rate

### Dashboard
1. Navigate to "Dashboard & Analytics" page
2. View overall compliance statistics
3. Analyze violation type distribution
4. Track compliance trends over time

## Model Training Notes

- **Quick Testing:** Use 10-20 epochs with yolov8n (nano)
- **Production Use:** Use 50-100+ epochs with yolov8s or yolov8m
- **GPU Recommended:** Training is much faster with GPU support
- **Memory:** Reduce batch size if you encounter out-of-memory errors

## Safety Violation Detection

The system identifies three main violation types:
1. **NO-Hardhat:** Workers without hard hats in construction zones
2. **NO-Safety Vest:** Workers without high-visibility vests
3. **NO-Mask:** Workers without protective masks (when required)

## Outcomes

- ✅ Identify safety compliance violations (missing helmets, vests, masks)
- ✅ Generate visualizations and alerts to improve safety
- ✅ Present results via real-time dashboard for administrators
- ✅ Track compliance trends and patterns
- ✅ Provide evidence with annotated images

## Future Enhancements

- Live video feed processing from surveillance cameras
- Automated email/SMS notification system
- Historical analytics with heatmaps
- Multi-camera support for large facilities
- PDF report generation
- Zone-based monitoring
- Real-time streaming dashboard
